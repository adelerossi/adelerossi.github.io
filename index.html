          ALOE is a magazine deals the artistic project of the Italian visual artist Marta Valpiana (Verona, 1993) and her project called “Neophyte”.</p>
          The artist analyzes the experience of plants in human life to understand her world, and consequently ours.
          For this reason each monograph has a precise date, which is the equinox of: Autumn (22 September 2019; 07:50 h); Spring (20 March 2019; 22:58 h)
          and the solstice of Winter ( 21 December 2019; 04:19 h) and Summer ( 21 June 2019; 15:54 h) and, also, presents the station’s namesake. 
          This editorial wants to show that the boundary between nature and culture, between art and urban, between human and wild can be much more indefinite than we are accustomed to think.

          Everything in our life creates feelings and emotions in us. If it was otherwise, nothing would make sense: each gesture, action, creation, and each experience. Moreover, our sensibility to colours establishes some emotions. The visible reality itself is coloured, in all of its aspects that surround us, and these colours evoke in us emotions and vibrations. The man, seen as both natural being and social being, experiences every day the emotions that the colour evokes with its history, its evolution and its ownerships. 
          This is the starting point addressed that constitute the ‘The Truth Is We Are Coloured’.</p> <p>The project is about the <span class="italic">psychology of colours</span>, more specifically about colours’ symbolism and how we use them in our everyday life. 
          The colour is a daily mystery that belongs to the life of each. For this reason I decided to analyze it and  then translate it into images that evoke such feelings.</p>
          This is my thesis project for my degree in New Technologies for Art at the Academy of Fine Arts. It was realize through a deep investigation and intersection between different fields of research such as history, philosophy, art, psychology and design. It was all made possible thank to the guidance of Francesca Valan, an italian Color Designer based in Milan. 
          Take a look at the video and at the thesis’s research.
